**Course Code:** CSS 262
**Duration:** 15 Weeks  
**Level:** Undergraduate (Bachelor's)  
**Credits:** 5-6 ECTS (Estimated)  

---

## 📖 Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive foundation in the administration, architecture, and security of Linux-based operating systems. Designed for future cybersecurity professionals, the curriculum moves beyond basic usage to focus on the "why" and "how" of system internals. Students will gain practical experience in command-line proficiency, service management, process control, and bash scripting.

Crucially, the course adopts a **"security-first"** approach. Key topics include system hardening, perimeter defense (firewalls), Mandatory Access Control (SELinux/AppArmor), and intrusion detection via audit logging. By the end of the semester, students will be capable of deploying, maintaining, and securing Linux environments against common threats, preparing them for roles in DevSecOps and Security Operations.

## ⚙️ Technical Requirements (Anti-Cheat Policy)

All graded scripts (Homework/Midterm/Final) run in a CI/CD pipeline.

1. **Dynamic Inputs:** Scripts must handle random filenames/users passed as variables. Hardcoding values will result in failure.
2. **Identity Verification:** Midterm flags are cryptographically tied to your GitHub username. Sharing code will result in flag mismatch and failure.
